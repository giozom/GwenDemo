   Feature: Google search

  @StepDef
  Scenario: I do a google search for "<query>"

            This is a custom step definition that accepts a query string as 
            input and performs a google search on it and checks for a returned 
            match. It is not immediately executed but rather loaded into 
            memory and executed only when referenced in another step by name.

      Given I navigate to "http://www.google.com"
        And the search field can be located by name "q"
       When I enter "$<query>" in the search field
       Then the page title should start with "$<query>"
        And the first result item can be located by class name "r"
        And the first result can be located by tag name "a" in the first result item
