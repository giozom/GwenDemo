   Feature: Google search
   
  Scenario: Perform a google search
            
            This scenario calls the a step definition defined in the Goolge.meta
            file to perform a google search for "gwen-web". It then clicks the 
            first link in the returned results and checks the title and URL of 
            the page that is loaded.
            
      Given I do a google search for "gwen-web"
       When I click the first result
       Then the page title should contain "gwen-interpreter/gwen-web"
        And the current URL should be "https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web"
