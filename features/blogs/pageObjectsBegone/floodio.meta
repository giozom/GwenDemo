    Given the next button can be located by class name "btn"

     Then the how old are you dropdown can be located by id "challenger_age"

Scenario: Configure step 3 page
     When I am on the step 3 page
     Then the largest order value function is "Math.max.apply(Math, $.map($('.radio'), function(x) { return parseInt($(x).text()); }))"
     Then the largest order value is defined by javascript "${the largest order value function}"
      And the largest order radio button can be located by javascript "$('.radio:contains("' + ${the largest order value function} + '") input[type="radio"]').get(0);"
      And the largest order input field can be located by id "challenger_largest_order"
