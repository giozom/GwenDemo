  To pick up the following:
  - Fixed tag filtering to accept tagged features and scenarios that have at 
    least one specified include tag and exclude all specified exclude tags. 
    The specified include and exclude tags are now partitioned and evaluated

  - Added support for configuring a ramp up interval (in seconds) for 
    staggered parallel execution ~ for user request issue gwen-interpreter/gwen#18. 
    The interval can be set through the `gwen.rampup.interval.seconds` setting
    This setting is only applicable for parallel execution mode. If it is 
    not set or is set to zero, then no staggering will occur (as per default 
    behavior). 
  - Added new `gwen.report.suppress.meta` setting for controlling whether or 
    not meta reports should be generated with HTML reports (default value is 
    false). If you have a lot of meta, suppressing the meta reports can 
    save a lot of disk space. Enabling this setting does not suppress the 
    hyperlinked stepdefs in feature reports (they will always be rendered).
- Added the following alternative DSL for closing the current browser session
  - I close the current browser

=====
Feb 29, 2016, 6:37 PM GMT+11 (AEDT)

    `I  <click|check|uncheck> <element> of <context>` results in a LocatorBindingException
- Immediately return from a 'should not' assertion step if it evaluates to true (instead of 
  waiting until timeout)

- Added the following DSLs for managing browser sessions (pull request #19):
  - I start a new browser
  - I close the current browser
  - I start a browser for <session>
  - I close the browser for <session>
  - I switch to <session>
- Added DSL for performing actions on context sensitive elements (pull request #18):
  - I <click|check|uncheck> <element> of <context>

1.1.1
=====

- Fixed #17 - Do nothing when checking/unchecking checkboxes or radio 
  buttons that are already checked or unchecked respectively 
  - Solution was to move the guards from the check and uncheck 
    pattern match clauses to their bodies instead

1.1.0
=====
Feb 11, 2016, 11:47 PM GMT+11 (AEDT)
- Added support for chaining locators through new DSL:
  - <element> can be located by <locator> "<expression>" in <container>
  - Where <container> can be 
    - An element
      - In this case <element> is located within the <container> element
    - A frame
      - In this case <element> is located within the page in the <container> 
        frame  
      - The WebEnvContext.withElement function will restore the previous window 
        in the web driver if the location of the element within the frame 
        fails on the first attempt. 
  - All element lookups and operations now occur inside the
    WebEnvContext.withElement function. This is where all 1st and 2nd lookup 
    attempts occur and where switching to the previous window is performed 
    when operations on elements are completed. The web engine no longer 
    calls the locator methods directly (it now calls withElement instead).
- Simplified assertion error messages
- Update selenium webdriver from v2.48.1 to v2.51.0
- Update Gwen from v1.0.1 to v[1.0.3](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen/releases/tag/v1.0.3)

1.0.2
=====
Jan 29, 2016, 5:13 PM GMT+11 (AEDT)
- Fixed problem with 1.0.1 release which had a snapshot dependency to Gwen
  in the maven POM file.

1.0.1
=====
Jan 26, 2016, 11:43 PM GMT+11 (AEDT)
- Resolved gwen-interpreter/gwen#15 - Use compact report attachment names
- Update Gwen from v1.0.0 to v[1.0.1](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen/releases/tag/v1.0.1)
